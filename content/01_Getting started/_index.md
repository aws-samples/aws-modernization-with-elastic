## Start the Elastic Environment via AWS Marketplace

Follow the video below to see how to enable Elastic via AWS Marketplace as well as how to get credentials for the Elastic environment. As we will use a CloudFormation script in order to prepare your workshop environment including an example application, you will need to run a different script then the one shown in the video. However, this is still a good starting point if you would like to test it as well within your own AWS environment at a later stage.
