## Observing vulnerabilities and compliance
Operating your services within AWS enables you to use the wide range of AWS-specific offerings in your application. Because of the complexity, the many different configuration options, and the shared responsibilities between AWS and your company, it's also possible to operate with less secure setups.

In order to prevent less secure setups, Elastic also provides support to you by observing the configurations of your services in use.

To observe and prevent vulnerabilities you can use the Elastic Endpoint Integration that is part of the Elastic Agent and use this to prevent any kind of malware or ransomware attacks to your used EC2 instances. As with all other integrations, the activation only needs a few clicks and is complete after a few minutes.

To observe compliance and configuration issues Elastic also provides Cloud Posture management in order to execute automatic audits and benchmarks against your environment.
