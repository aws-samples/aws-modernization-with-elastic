After finishing the workshop, you've learned how to work with a pre-installed Elastic Cluster within the sample AWS application. You've had a look into Logs, Metrics, and APM data which are just three parts of Elastic Observability. Elastic Observability has much more to offer.

If you would like to continue your journey with Elastic by adding data from your own environments, the best next step is to run our [terraform getting started scripts](https://ela.st/terraform). It works mostly the same as the workshop environment, but simply with your own data.

If you would like to learn more about Elastic Observability for AWS in general, please continue reading the next chapter.
